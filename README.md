# Schwarzschild-Black-String-perturbations
Mathematica notebooks to calculate metric perturbations of the Schwarzschild and black string spacetimes. They make use of the xAct package that is designed for manipulating tensors (see https://josmar493.dreamhosters.com/). Please be aware that the notebooks are not designed to run simultaneously, and it may occur that there are conflicting definitions. It is therefore best to quit the kernel entirely first when switching from one to the other notebook.

These notebooks are specifically designed for calculations from the master's thesis:

J. Janssen, B. Bonga and B. Krishnan, "Isospectrality of Quasi normal Mode Frequencies in Four- and Five-Dimensional Black Holes", MA thesis (Radboud University, Feb. 2025).
